                                Having launched some of the most cult fragrance brands into the UK market, thought
                                leader in art and design Liberty has launched a signature fragrance collection, the
                                first release from its new LBTY Beauty range.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The five gender-neutral fragrances are inspired by prints from the Liberty archive, and
                                each has been created by a hand-picked selection of the world’s most renowned perfumers,
                                jointly responsible for scents such as Le Labo Santal 33, Tom Ford Black Orchid and
                                White Patchouli, and YSL Black Opium.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Having rebranded Liberty in 2020 and collaborated on numerous projects since, Pentagram
                                was commissioned by Liberty to create a visual identity for its new beauty brand, as
                                well as design the packaging and elements of the bottle design for the new range of
                                fragrances.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Liberty Beauty’s typographic LBTY logotype features letterforms taken from the main
                                Liberty logotype, which was created from the lettering in the original sign above the
                                Great Marlborough Street storefront.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Pentagram’s Harry Pearce explains: “Since we re-designed the identity for Liberty we
                                have continued to expand the visual language of the business. Firstly in the form of
                                typographic patterns for fabrics and now into a pure beauty brand. On each occasion,
                                archival discoveries are the springboard for the designs.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Looking back into the visual history of Liberty we found interesting typographic
                                shorthands for the name. ‘LBTY’ is therefore a continuation of that graphic behaviour in
                                a new and unique manner.”
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Reflecting Liberty’s ethos of blending heritage and modernity, the fragrances are
                                contained in an elegant clear glass bottle with an understated black and white label on
                                the front. The pared-back label designs set in Akzindenz Grotesk Extended are a nod to
                                indexes of trademarked fabric names found in the Liberty archive. The oversized lid
                                showcases each Liberty print and features a gold debossed LBTY logo.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                One challenge with the perfume bottle design was the requirement to develop a
                                recognisable branded design without custom tooling for the glass bottle. The design team
                                opted for a custom oversized cap that covers most of the bottle including the label,
                                maximising the area available for the Liberty print. The lid can also be turned upside
                                down and used as a stand for the bottle. This approach provides a unique identity for
                                this line of high-end fragrances and hints at an overall design language for future LBTY
                                product categories.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                In contrast to the vibrant prints, the pared-back boxes are made from colour-saturated
                                uncoated paper and feature a foiled LBTY logotype, suggesting the understated luxury
                                that Liberty does so well. The boxes were designed to present the bottle in its upright
                                position when opened and use cardboard and paper as the primary construction material
                                while minimising the overall box size.
